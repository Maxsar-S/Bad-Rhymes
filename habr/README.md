Graduate project.

My team developed site to public articles, which can be commented, rated and moderate. 
Articles can be sorted and searched. Moderator has own administators's section, where he can block or ublock any article. 
Site has account verification using email. This project was based on Django Framework using CBV.

I have implemented an authentication and search system (authapp and searchapp)
